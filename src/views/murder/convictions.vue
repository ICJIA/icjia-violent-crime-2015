<p>Outcome information on arrest incidents that resulted in a court case is also entered into CHRI by circuit court clerks. Since murder cases can take years to resolve, court disposition information for 2012, 2013, and 2014 were examined to provide a more complete picture of murder case outcomes. </p>

<p>Researchers were able to find records for 1,538 court cases for murder that were adjudicated in Illinois criminal courts between 2012 and 2014. Of those, at least half resulted in a guilty verdict.</p>
