# ICJIA Violent Crime Data Project 2015

Protecting communities from violent crime and holding people accountable for their violent actions are at the heart of strategic federal Byrne/Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) planning. Knowing more about how Illinois is affected by violent crime can inform decision-making to best allocate scarce resources for maximum impact.

Violent crimes are defined nationally by the Federal Bureau of Identification (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, and at the state level by the Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (I-UCR) program administered by the Illinois State Police. In order to inform the stateâ€™s JAG strategic planning process, information on the prevalence of and subsequent criminal response of each of the four violent crime categories - murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault/battery - are presented here. These data can serve as context and foundation for the consideration of evidence-based and evidence-informed practices and programs aimed at the prevention of violent crime and the successful reintegration of previously violent offenders back into the community.
